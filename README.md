# Unexpected NaN behavior in conditional checks
This bug demonstrates unexpected behavior when using NaN (Not a Number) in JavaScript's conditional checks.  The function `foo` is designed to handle `null` and `undefined` values, but it behaves unexpectedly when passed `NaN`.

## Bug Description
The function `foo` should return a specific value for `null` and `undefined`. However, when `NaN` is passed, it doesn't trigger the conditional checks, returning `NaN` instead.  This is surprising because in many ways `NaN` acts unlike any other value in JavaScript. 

## How to Reproduce
1. Copy the code in `bug.js`
2. Run the code in a JavaScript environment (browser's console or Node.js).
3. Observe the unexpected output for `NaN` input.
